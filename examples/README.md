# Local Registry Spike

Just testing out how to use a Verdaccio local registry to run CLI tests

![CircleCI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/BigAB/local-registry-spike.svg?style=svg)

This is a spike, to see if I can create a test that publishes a package to the Verdaccio local registry, then use that package with an npx command, then delte the registry.
